 1. Before running any of the python scripts, check the env settings and venv setup [here](/deployment/smoke-tests-package/python/venv)

## Misc  
- For ```pip install pymqi```, need documentation in /Docs/dwh folder regarding how we installed pymqi library on DEV (12 / 14) machines from scratch. This is needed for automating pymqi installation in CIT/SIT environments. Ref: https://lifeinsuranceplatform.slack.com/archives/GQJQ8E7QX/p1582197433012700
